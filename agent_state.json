Thanks for connecting. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou just clicked on a simulated phishing link\u2014don\u2019t worry, this was a safe test! These exercises are designed to help us all stay sharp and safe online.\n\nPhishing happens when someone tries to trick you into clicking a fake link or sharing information, like passwords. These scams can look very real and may pretend to be from banks, work, or even friends.\n\nWhy is phishing dangerous?\n- It can steal your personal or work information.\n- Attackers might use your details for fraud or to get into accounts.\n- It can spread harmful software to your computer.\n\nHere are three easy tips to help keep you safe:\n1. Double-check the sender: If an email seems odd or asks for private info, look closely at the sender\u2019s address.\n2. Don\u2019t click links right away: Hover your mouse over links to see where they actually go. If you\u2019re unsure, type the website address yourself instead.\n3. Look for warning signs: Watch for bad spelling, urgent messages (\u201cact now!\u201d), or requests for secrets.\n\nIf something feels off, trust your gut and ask for help.
